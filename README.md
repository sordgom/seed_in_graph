GraphQL Queries for Smart Contracts
This project aims to demonstrate how to use GraphQL to query smart contracts on a blockchain network. In particular, we focus on using GraphQL to query Ethereum smart contracts.

Requirements
To use this project, you will need the following:

An Ethereum node to connect to (e.g., Ganache)
A smart contract ABI (Application Binary Interface) file
A GraphQL schema for the smart contract
A GraphQL server to execute the queries
Installation
To install the necessary dependencies for this project, run the following command:

Copy code
npm install
Usage
Before running the GraphQL server, make sure that you have set the following environment variables:

ETH_NODE_URL: the URL of the Ethereum node to connect to
SMART_CONTRACT_ABI: the path to the smart contract ABI file
SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS: the address of the deployed smart contract
To start the GraphQL server, run the following command:

sql
Copy code
npm start
This will start a GraphQL server at http://localhost:4000/graphql.

You can now use a GraphQL client (e.g., GraphQL Playground) to send queries to the server.

Examples
Here are some example GraphQL queries that you can use to interact with the smart contract:

graphql
Copy code
query {
  getBalance(address: "0x123...456") {
    balance
  }
}

query {
  getTransaction(txHash: "0xabc...def") {
    from
    to
    value
  }
}

mutation {
  transfer(to: "0x456...789", value: 100) {
    txHash
  }
}
These queries demonstrate how to get the balance of an address, get information about a transaction, and transfer tokens to another address.
